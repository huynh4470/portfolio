                     <h3>Project Details</h3>
                     <p> During my time at Sun Life, I got the chance to partake in creating eight service blueprints, one for each of Sun Life's investment products. These service blueprints map out a detailed view of the front stage interactions with advisors and clients, in addition to all the backstage staff and systems that support the advisor and client. In summary, the blueprints describe the roles for all the major actors involved in the delivery of the service. </p> 
                     <p> 
                        The goal of these blueprints is to determine which features to prioritize and to assess the current state. Pain points are mapped out along the blueprints to help the Product Owner determine what issue needs to be addressed. These blueprints were also made to enable teams to see the full picture of the process of applying for an investment product. </p>
